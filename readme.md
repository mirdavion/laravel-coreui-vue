# Laravel 5.4 + CoreUI Admin Bootstrap Template VueJS


## What is this?

A clean install of Laravel 5.4 with the [CoreUI Full Bootstrap Admin Template VueJS Version](https://github.com/mrholek/CoreUI-Free-Bootstrap-Admin-Template/tree/master/Vue_Full_Project) added in. This implementation is nowhere near to perfect but it's a working start. Pull Requests are welcome!


## What's it look like?

## Getting Started
